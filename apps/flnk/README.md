Every redirect resolves at the edge from a KV cache with a D1 fallback; every
click is logged to **Cloudflare Analytics Engine** with the raw IP hashed on the
way in — so you get per-link geo / device / referrer analytics without ever
storing a visitor's IP or shipping data to an analytics vendor.

## Why

Off-the-shelf shorteners make you choose between control and privacy: the hosted
ones track your visitors for you, the self-hosted ones are a VM you babysit.
`flnk` is neither — it's a single Worker you deploy to your own Cloudflare
account:

- **Server-authoritative redirects** — the destination, routing rules, and gates
  live in D1, not in the URL. Change where a link points without reissuing it.
- **Routing built in** — one short link can send visitors to different
  destinations by **country** (`request.cf.country`) or **device** (iOS → App
  Store, Android → Play Store), with UTM / query passthrough.
- **Analytics you own** — clicks land in *your* Analytics Engine dataset. The
  visitor IP is HMAC-hashed with a daily-rotating salt before storage, so
  uniqueness counts work but the raw IP is never persisted or recoverable.
- **Gates, not dead ends** — a link can require a password, show a safety
  interstitial, cloak behind an OG preview, or expire after N clicks — all
  enforced at the edge before the redirect fires.
- **One binary, no servers** — Next.js compiled through
  [OpenNext](https://opennext.js.org/cloudflare) to a single Worker; D1 + KV +
  Analytics Engine are the only moving parts, and R2 is optional.

## Features

| Area | What you get |
| --- | --- |
| **Redirect** | Configurable `308` / `307` / `302`, per-colo rate limiting, negative caching, case-(in)sensitivity, `?query` passthrough. |
| **Routing** | Per-country destinations, iOS / Android overrides — evaluated at the edge from one row. |
| **Gates** | Argon2id link passwords, "unsafe link" interstitial, OG cloaking, click-count expiry, time expiry, pause toggle. |
| **QR** | Per-link styled QR (colors, logo, dot / corner style, error level); scans are tagged `source=qr` in analytics. |
| **Analytics** | Country / region / city / referrer / device / OS / browser / language breakdowns, realtime feed, geo map, CSV export — from your own dataset. |
| **Launchpads** | Hosted link-in-bio / landing pages at `/m/<slug>` with a themable block editor; buttons reference short links, so clicks reuse their stats. |
| **AI** | Optional slug suggestions and OG title / description generation via Workers AI. |
| **Ops** | Daily cron: R2 backup + soft-delete of expired links; link health checks (reachability + Safe Browsing via DoH); Sink import / export. |
| **Auth** | better-auth social login (Google / GitHub) with an email allow-list; every `/api/*` route is session-gated server-side. |
| **i18n** | English + Chinese (`next-intl`) with a cookie-based locale, so it never collides with the root `[slug]` route. |

## Quick start

`flnk` is part of the [`@cdlab/projects-monorepo`](../../README.md); run everything
from the repo root.

```bash
pnpm install                          # builds workspace packages too
pnpm --filter @cdlab/flnk cf:localdb  # apply D1 migrations to the local DB
pnpm --filter @cdlab/flnk dev         # -> http://flnk.localhost:3355
```

The dev URL is fixed by [`@dotns/nsl`](https://github.com/dotns/nsl) — no port
hunting. The dashboard lives at `/dashboard`; short links resolve at the root
(`/<slug>`), launchpads at `/m/<slug>`.

Before you can sign in, set the auth secrets in `.dev.vars` (see
`.dev.vars.example`): `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`, at least one Google / GitHub client
id + secret pair, and — recommended — `ALLOWED_EMAILS` so only you can register.

## How a redirect resolves

```
GET /<slug>
  1. reserved-slug + rate-limit + slug-shape guards         reject early
  2. resolveLink: KV cache → D1 fallback → backfill cache    negative-cached on miss
  3. expiry / disabled / click-cap checks                    purge cache, serve 404
  4. password gate?      → serve form / verify (Argon2id)    per-IP attempt limit
  5. cloaking / crawler? → serve OG HTML instead of 3xx
  6. unsafe link?        → serve confirm interstitial
  7. resolveDestination: geo → device → query passthrough
  8. writeAccessLog (waitUntil, off the critical path)       IP hashed, never stored raw
  9. 308 Location: <destination>
```

Steps 1–3 are the hot path most requests take; the KV read is the only I/O for a
cached, gate-free link.

    D -->|"found & live"| E["fill positive cache"]
    E --> R
    D -->|"not found"| F["seed negative cache (short TTL)"]
    F --> N
```

The full model — every gate, its ordering rationale, and the security reasoning —
is in [`DESIGN.md`](DESIGN.md).

## Slugs

A short link's slug comes from one of three paths:

- **Auto** (default) — a random slug over an unambiguous alphabet (no `0/o/1/l/i`),
  6 chars by default, allocated race-safely (`onConflictDoNothing` + an
  escalating-length retry, so concurrent creates never collide).
- **Custom** — a slug you choose; it's validated, and a previously deleted one is
  revived in place.
- **AI-suggested** — an opt-in Workers-AI suggestion derived from the destination
  URL (prompt-injection-guarded, KV-cached), which the dashboard submits as a
  custom slug.

Details in [`DESIGN.md`](DESIGN.md#64-slug-allocation).

## Configuration

All knobs are `vars` in [`wrangler.jsonc`](wrangler.jsonc); reads go through a
single validated config (`src/lib/platform/env.ts`). Secrets are **never** vars —
set them in `.dev.vars` (local) or via `wrangler secret put` (prod).

| Var | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `DB_TYPE` | `d1` | Driver: `d1` (the `DB` binding) or `libsql` (Turso, via `LIBSQL_URL` + token). |
| `REDIRECT_STATUS_CODE` | `308` | Redirect status for a normal click. |
| `LINK_CACHE_TTL` | `60` | KV positive-cache TTL (seconds; floored to 60 by KV). |
| `NEGATIVE_CACHE_TTL` | `60` | Tombstone TTL for missing slugs (`0` disables; blocks cache-penetration scans). |
| `REDIRECT_WITH_QUERY` | `false` | Forward the incoming `?query` onto the destination (per-link overridable). |
| `CASE_SENSITIVE` | `false` | Treat `/AbC` and `/abc` as distinct slugs. |
| `SLUG_DEFAULT_LENGTH` | `6` | Length of an auto-generated slug. |
| `NOT_FOUND_REDIRECT` | *(empty)* | Where to send an unknown slug (empty = plain `404`). |
| `HOME_URL` | *(empty)* | Optional redirect for the bare root. |
| `RESOLVE_RATE_LIMIT_ENABLED` | `true` | Per-IP rate limit on the resolve path (fails open if the binding is absent). |
| `DATASET` | `flnk_analytics` | Analytics Engine dataset name. |
| `DISABLE_BOT_ACCESS_LOG` | `false` | Skip logging obvious bot traffic. |
| `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` | — | Account id for the Analytics Engine SQL API (dashboard reads). |
| `SAFE_BROWSING_DOH` | *(empty)* | DoH resolver for link health checks (empty = disabled). |
| `AI_MODEL` | `@cf/meta/llama-3.1-8b-instruct` | Workers AI model for slug / OG generation. |

**Secrets** (`.dev.vars` / `wrangler secret put`): `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`,
`GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` / `SECRET`, `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` / `SECRET`, `ALLOWED_EMAILS`,
`CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` (Analytics `Read`), `LIBSQL_AUTH_TOKEN`,
`ANALYTICS_IP_SALT`. See [`wrangler.jsonc`](wrangler.jsonc) for the full
annotated list.

## Bindings

| Binding | Type | Purpose | Required |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `DB` | D1 | Links, launchpads, tags, auth tables — source of truth. | ✓ (or `libsql`) |
| `KV` | KV | Redirect cache, negative cache, visit counters, password-attempt + gate-token buckets. | ✓ |
| `ANALYTICS` | Analytics Engine | Click / view / block-click data points. | ✓ for stats |
| `AI` | Workers AI | Slug + OG suggestions. | optional |
| `RESOLVE_RATE_LIMIT` | Rate Limiting | Per-IP throttle on `/<slug>`. | optional |
| `R2` | R2 | QR / OG asset uploads + daily backups. | optional (commented out by default) |
| `ASSETS` | Static assets | OpenNext build output. | ✓ |

## Endpoints

| Route | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `GET/POST /<slug>` | Public redirect + gates (the redirect engine). |
| `GET /<slug>/og` | OG preview image for a link. |
| `GET /m/<slug>` | Public launchpad (link-in-bio) page. |
| `/dashboard/*` | Session-gated console: links, analytics, realtime, launchpads, check, migrate, settings. |
| `/api/auth/[...all]` | better-auth handler. |
| `/api/link/*` | Link CRUD, list / search, tags, import / export, AI slug / OG, health check. |
| `/api/launchpad/*` | Launchpad CRUD, publish, query, stats, view / click tracking. |
| `/api/stats/*`, `/api/logs/*` | Analytics Engine queries: metrics, counters, views, events, locations, CSV export. |
| `/api/upload/image`, `/api/asset/[...key]` | R2 asset upload + serve. |
| `/api/backup`, `/api/config`, `/api/location` | Manual backup, public config, geo lookup. |

Every `/api/*` handler runs `requireSession` server-side; there is no client-only
gate.

## Build, test & deploy

```bash
pnpm --filter @cdlab/flnk lint        # next lint
pnpm --filter @cdlab/flnk test        # vitest (redirect / analytics / health-check units)
pnpm --filter @cdlab/flnk build       # next build (type-check + bundle)
```

Deploys go through the `deploy-flnk.yml` GitHub workflow (manual dispatch); it
runs `opennextjs-cloudflare build && deploy` and syncs the `FLNK_`-prefixed
secrets. Database migrations apply separately:

```bash
pnpm --filter @cdlab/flnk db:gen        # generate a migration from schema.ts
pnpm --filter @cdlab/flnk cf:remotedb   # apply migrations to the remote D1
```

> Migrations must be generated with the **sqlite** dialect (`DB_TYPE=d1`); the
> default `libsql` dialect emits `ALTER COLUMN` statements that D1 rejects.

## Performance & engineering

The redirect path is the hottest route in the system, so it's built to stay cheap
and correct under load:

- **One KV read, zero D1 on a cache hit** — a resolved link is served from a
  read-through KV cache; D1 is touched only on a cold miss, then the result is
  backfilled.
- **Cache-penetration proof** — a missing slug writes a short-TTL negative
  tombstone, and malformed slugs are shape-rejected before any I/O, so 404 floods
  and scanners never reach D1.
- **Logging off the critical path** — click analytics are written via
  `ctx.waitUntil`, so they never add latency to the redirect itself.
- **Edge-native rate limiting** — the per-IP resolve limit is a per-colo, in-memory
  binding, so it costs no D1/KV quota.
- **Parsed once per isolate** — the env config (Zod-validated) and the auth
  instance are memoized for the isolate's lifetime, not rebuilt per request.
- **Race-safe writes** — random slugs are allocated with `onConflictDoNothing`
  (the unique index arbitrates atomically — no check-then-insert race) plus an
  escalating-length retry; the click cap pays one KV read on the hot path and
  increments in the background.
- **Correct under sampling** — Analytics Engine reads are sampling-weighted
  (`SUM(_sample_interval)`), and the visitor IP is HMAC-hashed inline, never
  stored raw.

The mechanisms behind each point are specified in [`DESIGN.md`](DESIGN.md) — §4
(caching) and §5 (gates).

## Design

[`DESIGN.md`](DESIGN.md) is the authoritative spec — the redirect engine and its
caching model, the security gates and their ordering rationale, the data model,
the privacy-preserving analytics pipeline, the launchpad system, and the auth /
multi-tenancy design. Read it before changing resolution order, cache
invalidation, or the analytics blob layout.
